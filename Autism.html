      <p><font size="5px">What is Autism?</font>
<br>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability  that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. There is often nothing about how people with ASD look that sets them apart from other people, but people with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. The learning, thinking, and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted to severely challenged. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others need less.

<br>A diagnosis of ASD now includes several conditions that used to be diagnosed separately: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. These conditions are now all called autism spectrum disorder.

<br><br>
<font size="5px">Signs and Symptoms</font>
<br>People with ASD often have problems with social, emotional, and communication skills. They might repeat certain behaviors and might not want change in their daily activities. Many people with ASD also have different ways of learning, paying attention, or reacting to things. Signs of ASD begin during early childhood and typically last throughout a person’s life.

<br>Children or adults with ASD might:
<ul>
<li>not point at objects to show interest (for example, not point at an airplane flying over).</li>
<li>not look at objects when another person points at them.</li>
<li>have trouble relating to others or not have an interest in other people at all.</li>
<li>avoid eye contact and want to be alone.</li>
<li>have trouble understanding other people’s feelings or talking about their own feelings.</li>
<li>prefer not to be held or cuddled, or might cuddle only when they want to.</li>
<li>appear to be unaware when people talk to them, but respond to other sounds.</li>
<li>be very interested in people, but not know how to talk, play, or relate to them.</li>
<li>repeat or echo words or phrases said to them, or repeat words or phrases in place of normal language.</li>
<li>have trouble expressing their needs using typical words or motions.</li>
<li>not play “pretend” games (for example, not pretend to “feed” a doll).</li>
<li>repeat actions over and over again.</li>
<li>have trouble adapting when a routine changes.</li>
<li>have unusual reactions to the way things smell, taste, look, feel, or sound.</li>
<li>lose skills they once had (for example, stop saying words they were using).</li>
</ul>

<br><br><font size="5px">Treatment and Intervention Services for Autism Spectrum Disorder</font>
<br><br>Currently, no treatment has been shown to cure ASD, but several interventions have been developed and studied for use with young children. These interventions may reduce symptoms, improve cognitive ability and daily living skills, and maximize the ability of the child to function and participate in the community.

<br><br>The differences in how ASD affects each person means that people with ASD have unique strengths and challenges in social communication, behavior, and cognitive ability. Therefore, treatment plans are usually multidisciplinary, may involve parent-mediated interventions, and target the child’s individual needs.

<br><br>Behavioral intervention strategies have focused on social communication skill development—particularly at young ages when the child would naturally be gaining these skills—and reduction of restricted interests and repetitive and challenging behaviors. For some children, occupational and speech therapy may be helpful, as could social skills training and medication in older children. The best treatment or intervention can vary depending on an individual’s age, strengths, challenges, and differences.

<br><br>It is also important to remember that children with ASD can get sick or injured just like children without ASD. Regular medical and dental exams should be part of a child’s treatment plan. Often it is hard to tell if a child’s behavior is related to the ASD or is caused by a separate health condition. For instance, head banging could be a symptom of ASD, or it could be a sign the child is having headaches or earaches. In those cases, a thorough physical examination is needed. Monitoring healthy development means not only paying attention to symptoms related to ASD, but also to the child’s physical and mental health.

<br><br>Not much is known about the best interventions for older children and adults with ASD. There has been some research on social skills groups for older children, but there is not enough evidence to show that these are effective. Additional research is needed to evaluate interventions designed to improve outcomes in adulthood. In addition, services are important to help individuals with ASD complete their education or job training, find employment, secure housing and transportation, take care of their health, improve daily functioning, and participate as fully as possible in their communities.
<br><br><font size="5px">Types of Treatments</font>
<br><br>There are many types of treatments available. These include applied behavior analysis, social skills training, occupational therapy, physical therapy, sensory integration therapy, and the use of assistive technology.

<br><br>The types of treatments generally can be broken down into the following categories:
<ul>
<li>Behavior and Communication Approaches.</li>
<li>Dietary Approaches.</li>
<li>Medication.</li>
<li>Complementary and Alternative Medicine.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><font size="5px">Some of the Common Therapies:</font>
<ul>
  <li>Occupational Therapy
    <br>These activities help children with autism get better at everyday tasks, like learning to button a shirt or hold a fork properly. But it can involve anything related to school, work or play. The focus depends on the child’s needs and goals.

    <br>
    <li>Speech Therapy
    <br>This helps children with speaking, as well as communicating and interacting with others. It can involve non-verbal skills, like making eye contact, taking turns in a conversation, and using and understanding gestures. It might also teach kids to express themselves using picture symbols, sign language, or computers. To be most effective, speech therapists need to work closely with parents and teachers to practice these skills in daily life.

    <br>
    <li>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)
    <br>This type of therapy uses rewards to reinforce positive behaviors and teach new skills. Parents and other caregivers are trained so they can give the autistic child moment-by-moment feedback. Treatment goals are based on the individual. They might include communication, social skills, personal care, and school work. Studies show children who receive early, intensive ABA can make big, lasting gains.
